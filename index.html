    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines how this application ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. As an individual developer, I strive to keep your data secure and respect your privacy. However, please note that the App is provided "as is" without any guarantees or warranties regarding its functionality or data protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not intentionally collect any personal information. However, it may use third-party libraries or services (such as AdMob or analytics tools) that may collect anonymous data to improve performance or serve advertisements. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
        Any information collected by third-party services is used solely for their intended purposes, such as analytics or advertisements. No data is shared, sold, or misused by the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        This App may include third-party services, such as advertising platforms or analytics providers. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and I encourage you to review them to understand how your data may be handled:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        While reasonable measures are taken to ensure the App's security, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. Therefore, I cannot guarantee absolute security for any data processed by third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance with App Store Policies</h2>
    <p>
        This App complies with the guidelines and policies set forth by the Apple App Store. Any data collection, if applicable, is designed to adhere to these standards to ensure user privacy and transparency.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and it is your responsibility to review this policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me via email: <a href="mailto:developer@example.com">developer@example.com</a>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        This App is provided "as is" and is intended for use "at your own risk." The developer disclaims all liability for any issues or damages resulting from the use of this App.
